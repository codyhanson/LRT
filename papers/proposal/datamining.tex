\section{Mining trace data}
Once we collect enough data, we can compare user experience between versions
of an app, as well as across apps by categorizing actions well. Additionally
we can compare trace events that occurred against a reference of what events
are possible to produce a rough idea of functional code coverage. Further
more, we can produce something along the lines of a "cross-platform coverage"
giving developers an indication of how well their app is tested on different
devices and OS'es. We could take this a step further to identify "troublesome"
devices and OS'es by looking for common error events across apps running on the
same device and OS.
