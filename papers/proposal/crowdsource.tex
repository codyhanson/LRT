\section{Crowd sourcing for large scale trace acquisition}
One of the key issues with testing mobile applications is the sheer number
of different scenarios that can affect the execution and performance
of the App under test. It is impossible for developers to test their application
on every hardware configuration, for all use models, for all environmental scenarios.
Due to this fact, we believe that using the LRT system to 'crowd source' data for developers
is the answer.

\section{Motivating Participation}
Any savvy user will understand that opting into using this system comes at a cost to themselves.
Their phone will be expending extra energy and network capacity to support the tracing of 
other peoples applications, which they build for fun and profit.
In order to encourage more users to opt in, we will need to compensate them for their
help, or make it fun for them to volunteer.
