\section{Introduction}
One of the key tasks a mobile application developer must undertake is testing 
their application on real hardware, and with real users. This is important 
because there are many features that are available to apps running on hardware 
that are not available in emulation software. These include GPS, accelerometer, 
magnetometer, gyroscope, and Cellular data, as well as the rest of the 
complexity of the system that is impossible to recreate perfectly in an 
emulation layer. Real users and their environments also may exercise apps in
a way developers have not anticipated. 

We propose a system which will allow developers of applications on internet connected 
devices to easily embed lightweight instrumentation 
into their application code to enable high resolution 
tracing of program execution to a cloud service. Events are collected by 
the service which can perform analytics on program execution as it is 
exercised out in the wild.

Successful completion of this work will serve to accomplish a few key 
improvements for testing mobile applications. This instrumentation will provide 
the developer with a trace of the program running on actual hardware, not just 
an emulator, as the opportunity to collect the trace while the application is 
subjected to real life users and environment interaction. With this 
body of program flow data collected on the server, we can mine it for useful 
information to answer questions such as ``\emph{which parts of the user interface were 
confusing to the user?}'', and ``\emph{Did they spend too much time wondering what to do 
next?}'', or ``\emph{which flows are common for users to take, and could thus be 
streamlined to create a better user experience?}'' Problems of this nature are 
discussed in \cite{WebAntiPattern}.
