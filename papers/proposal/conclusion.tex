\section{Conclusion}
This research proposal presented LRT, the Live Remote Tracing system. We discussed
the benefits of being able to gather detailed trace data from actual smartphone application
users, and how exporting the gathered data to the cloud will enable interesting approaches
such as gameification and market-based testing incentives, and big data analysis of
trace data from many users and apps. We outlined challenges to the completion of the research,
how our proposed design seeks to address those challenges, and finally, some ideas on how to
evaluate our system once it has been implemented.
